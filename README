This plugin expects to run on the host running BIND.

Please run it with --help to see where it expects to find a variety of
files and commands, and the options you are likely to require to
provide.

The process the plugin goes through is:

1. Check for existence of file at --pid-path
   Return critical failure if missing/empty

2. Read the PID contents of file at --pid-path 
   Obtain a process list (either 'ps auxww' or 'ps -ef' depending on your OS).
   Return critical failure if PID is not in the process list

3. Execute 'rndc stats'  (--rndc-path --rndc-args stats)
   in order to generate the latest stats into --stats-path
   NOTE: You may need to a. configure BIND to dump statistics at a path
   b. configure something to regularly roll/truncate the stats file

4. open the file --stats-path, seek backwards --stats-seek bytes
   read the file and parse the last statistics block for the 
   numbers we are interested in for performance data.
   Return a warning if we cannot open and read the file, or do not
   find a statistics block.

5. Execute 'rndc status' (--rndc-path --rndc-args status)
   and parse its output for more performance data.
   Return a warning if we cannot find any status data.

6. Return status and any performance data.
